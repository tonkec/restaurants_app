# Fake app for fetching restaurants

This is a fake app made as a test project for one company I really like :)

### How to start this app?

1. clone the repo
2. cd into the project
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm start`
5. go to `localhost`

### What technologies are used in this app?

1. React
2. [random api](https://random-data-api.com/api/restaurant/random_restaurant?size=30)
3. [fake auth api](https://reqres.in/)
4. [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
5. typescript

### How did I manage the tasks?

I just had a small todo list [here](https://github.com/tonkec/restaurants_app/blob/master/TODO.md). In real life I would use Jira, Asana or smth similar.

### What am I proud of in this app?

I like how I handled the loading of [Restaurants](https://github.com/tonkec/restaurants_app/blob/master/src/components/Restaurants/Restaurants.tsx). I think it is pretty neat and clean. What do you think?

I also like my design even though I don't like boxy layouts. LOL.

### What could have I done better?

I probably should have used Firebase, but I just did not have enough time to implement the whole database. The other thing is that in real life I would rather code mini Rails app with API RESTful routes.

This app should be probably tested as well. LOL. ðŸ˜€

### What am I going to use this app for?

I am going to use this app for practising. I think I can learn a lot about React with this app.

### What is the next step, Antonija?

I would love to explore React query and implement it. It should be fun. I heard only good stuff about it.

### Thanks for reading!
